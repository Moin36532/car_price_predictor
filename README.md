🚘 Car Price Predictor

This project is a Machine Learning-based Car Price Predictor that estimates the price of a car based on its features and sales data collected from Pakistan’s automobile market.

It’s a great use case for understanding how Machine Learning can help make data-driven decisions — especially for car buyers and sellers in Pakistan! 🇵🇰

🚀 Project Overview

Ever wondered what your car is worth? 🤔
This project uses a Random Forest Regression Model trained on real sales data to predict car prices accurately.
Simply enter details like brand, model, year, mileage, and fuel type — and the model will predict the estimated market price.

🧠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Streamlit – for building the web app UI

Scikit-learn – for machine learning algorithms

Random Forest Regressor – used for prediction

Pandas & NumPy – for data preprocessing and manipulation

⚙️ How It Works

The user provides car details such as make, model, year, mileage, etc.

The data is preprocessed and fed into a trained Random Forest model.

The model outputs the predicted price of the car.

The Streamlit interface displays the result instantly with an intuitive UI.
